# 🕵️‍♂️ Crime Data Analysis and Prediction (Python)

An end-to-end Data Science project that analyzes and predicts crime patterns using **Python** and **Machine Learning**.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying trends, hotspots, and correlations in crime data across regions.  
It includes **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **machine learning model building** for crime classification and prediction.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code  

---

## 🧾 Dataset
- Contains columns such as: `City`, `State`, `Crime_Type`, `Case_Status`, `Year`, `Month`, `Victim_Gender`, `Suspect_Gender`
- Source: Public crime data repositories (India, UK, or USA datasets)

---

## 📊 Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Engineering and Encoding  
4. Model Building (Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN, XGBoost)  
5. Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  

---

## 📈 Results
| Model | Accuracy | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
|--------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Random Forest | 92% | 0.90 | 0.93 |
| XGBoost | 94% | 0.91 | 0.95 |

✅ **Best Model:** XGBoost Classifier
